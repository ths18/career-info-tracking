This code was a simple port scanner developed for an Ethical Hacking course. 
The two scanners are nearly identical with their main difference being whether it was written as a series of functions and a main function or a class
The first script is able to take several host names or IPs as a parameter and parse them to scan each individually. Script #2 only handles one at a time.

Disclaimer: The original code that mine was based on was skeletonized and provided by the university. I created the body of every function, but not necessarily the function name.
