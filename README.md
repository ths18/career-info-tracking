*This repository is intended to track my professional progress

My name is Tyler Stokes, and I am a junior at UWF majoring in Cybersecurity, with a minor in Computer Science and a minor in Criminal Justice.
I am actively involved with the Cyber Club, and take the role of training newer students who may be afraid to get out of their comfort zone.

I have ambition to work as a red teamer / pentester and am currently developing a skillset that will help me to be as effective as possible. I have competed in SECCDC, NCAE Cyber Games, and NCL in 2022. 

I have long term ambitions to use my skillset to make a difference in the world. One major driving point in my life is a passion to reduce trafficking and cyber crimes against children. 

Thank you for stopping by this page.
